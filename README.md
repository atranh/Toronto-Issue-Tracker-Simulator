# Toronto-Issue-Tracker-Simulator

• An application that tracks known issues and requests in Toronto, allowing citizens to report and upvote problems, and then track the resolution of those issues

•	Accurately pinpoint hot spots by using the Google Maps API along with a description of the problem

•	Constructed a system that could create, authenticate, and manage accounts by mimicking a database in the browser’s local storage
